As silly as this sounds, it''s amazing how many people will open a web page with a huge amount of text and then spend copious amounts of time reading through the whole dang thing until they find what they''re looking for. Years ago, an executive in my company was watching me look for info on a series of pages and he was amazed by my frequent use of CTRL-F to quickly hone in on the data I was looking for.


I often find myself needing to retrieve the plain-text value of a password that''s been saved for me in Chrome. By default, the password field is always displayed with <input type="password"/>, which means that the "text" is obfuscated from me. So I inspect the <input> element, change it to <input type="text"/>, and I can grab the raw password value that''s stored in my browser.


I''m also far more likely to use the dev tools to.... "borrow" any of the assets that are used to build the page.
